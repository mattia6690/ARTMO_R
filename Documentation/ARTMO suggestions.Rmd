This script is for highlighting possible **Errors** or suggestions (Plain Text) I noticed during my work with the ARTMO Software. 
Issues or suggestions that have been either applied or rejected are ~~stroken through~~

### General

+ **New DB** Error when generating new Database -> Field not filled
+ Probability Density for Prosail Model includes: ![Error](K:\SentinelVegetationProducts\S2_LAI\Errors\Probability Density Function.png)


### Modules

+ Sensor Module. Maybe Include the spatial Resolution in the Sensor description? Especially useful for Sentinel-2
+ **Sensor Module**. Help -> Spelling Error "Installation"
+ ~~Sensor Module Export of band settings (as csv?) -> Easy setting import~~

### Modeling

+ Export Model Parameters to .txt file possible? With the annotation of the Project name or the name of the Iteration. Important Information:
  + Project Name and name of the database
  + Forward Modelling process. Which models are implemented (e.g. Prospect4+SAIL)
  + Parametrization of the Models
+ Can't cancel the Forwarding process one started

### Retrieval (LUT Inversion)

+ CF Table. Export of the Measured/Estimated COST Function LAI -> Plotting in R
+ Retrieval. Export of the Inputs (Images selected + COST Function applied)
+ Validation. Warning message "Warning: The input to STR2FUNC "0510_v1" is not a valid function name. This will generate an error in a future release. "

### Retrieval (Machine Learning)

### Possibilities of R

+ It could be useful to establish a local workplace the persons are working in (Input, Output, Metadata etc). This is useful when other Programming Languages are used
+ Standardized Workflow afterwards seems to be more important the more I use ARTMO
+ Use of Markdown for Documenting specific usecases or a single explainatory Workflow -> ARTMO Website
  + Instruction on how to use
  + Instruction on what modules there are and how they interact with each other.
