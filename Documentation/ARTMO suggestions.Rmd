This script is for highlighting possible **Errors** or suggestions (Plain Text) I noticed during my work with the ARTMO Software. 
Issues or suggestions that have been either applied or rejected are ~~stroken through~~

### General

### Modules

+ Sensors Module. Maybe Include the spatial Resolution in the Sensor description? Especially useful for Sentinel-2

### Modeling

### Retrieval (LUT Inversion)

### Retrieval (Machine Learning)

### Possibilities of R

+ It could be useful to establish a local workplace the persons are working in (Input, Output, Metadata etc). This is useful when other Programming Languages are used
+ Standardized Workflow afterwards?
